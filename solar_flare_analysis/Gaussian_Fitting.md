# 1. Physical Foundation: Solar Flare Physics

## 1.1 Why Gaussian Models Work for Solar Flares

Solar flares are explosive releases of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's corona. The X-ray emission from flares follows predictable temporal profiles due to the underlying physical processes:

### **Magnetic Reconnection Physics**
- **Energy Release**: Magnetic field lines reconnect, converting magnetic energy to kinetic and thermal energy
- **Plasma Heating**: Electrons are accelerated and heat the coronal plasma to >10⁷ K
- **X-ray Emission**: Hot plasma emits thermal bremsstrahlung X-rays in two energy bands:
  - **XRSA (0.5-4.0 Å)**: Lower energy, cooler plasma component
  - **XRSB (1.0-8.0 Å)**: Higher energy, hotter plasma component

### **Temporal Evolution**
The characteristic Gaussian profile emerges because:
1. **Impulsive Phase**: Rapid energy injection creates a sharp rise
2. **Peak Phase**: Maximum energy release rate
3. **Decay Phase**: Exponential cooling as energy dissipates

### **Superposition Principle**
Complex flare events often consist of multiple overlapping energy release episodes, making multi-Gaussian decomposition physically meaningful for separating individual reconnection events.

# 2. Mathematical Framework

## 2.1 Core Gaussian Model

The fundamental building block is the **Gaussian function**:

```
f(t) = A × exp(-½((t - μ)/σ)²)
```

**Parameters:**
- **A (Amplitude)**: Peak X-ray flux [W m⁻²] - measures flare intensity
- **μ (Center)**: Time of peak flux [minutes] - timing of energy release
- **σ (Width)**: Standard deviation [minutes] - duration characteristic

**Physical Meaning:**
- **FWHM = 2.355σ**: Full Width at Half Maximum - flare duration
- **Area ∝ A×σ**: Total energy released during the flare event

## 2.2 Multi-Gaussian Decomposition

For complex flare events with N overlapping components:

```
F(t) = Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ Aᵢ × exp(-½((t - μᵢ)/σᵢ)²)
```

This represents the **linear superposition** of N individual flare events occurring simultaneously or sequentially.

# 3. Statistical Methodology

## 3.1 Peak Detection Algorithm

### **Primary Detection** (`find_peaks`)
```python
peaks, properties = find_peaks(signal, 
                              height=max_signal*0.1,
                              prominence=0.005)
```

**Statistical Criteria:**
- **Height Threshold**: Peaks must exceed 10% of maximum signal
- **Prominence**: Measures peak isolation from local background
  ```
  prominence = peak_height - max(left_base, right_base)
  ```

### **Highest Peak Identification**
The algorithm identifies the **global maximum** and extracts a surrounding region for detailed analysis:

```python
highest_peak_idx = peaks[np.argmax(peak_heights)]
window_size = estimated_width × window_factor
```

**Mathematical Basis:** Focuses analysis on the most energetic event while maintaining sufficient context for overlapping component detection.

## 3.2 Advanced Peak Width Estimation

```python
widths = peak_widths(signal, [peak_idx], rel_height=0.1)[0]
```

Uses the **10% relative height** criterion to estimate characteristic timescales, providing robust width estimation even for asymmetric profiles.

# 4. Optimization Framework

## 4.1 Differential Evolution Algorithm

The algorithm uses **global optimization** via differential evolution rather than local methods like Levenberg-Marquardt:

### **Why Differential Evolution?**
1. **Global Optimization**: Avoids local minima in complex parameter spaces
2. **Parameter Bounds**: Enforces physically reasonable constraints
3. **Robustness**: Works well with noisy data and poor initial guesses

### **Objective Function**
```python
def objective(params):
    fitted = multi_gaussian(region_time, *params)
    residuals = region_signal - fitted
    return np.sum(residuals**2)  # Least squares criterion
```

**Mathematical Form:**
```
χ² = Σᵢ (yᵢ - f(tᵢ, θ))²
```
Where θ represents the parameter vector [A₁, μ₁, σ₁, A₂, μ₂, σ₂, ...]

## 4.2 Parameter Bounds and Constraints

### **Physical Constraints**
```python
# Amplitude bounds
bounds_lower.extend([max_signal * 0.05, min_time, time_range * 0.02])
bounds_upper.extend([max_signal * 2.0, max_time, time_range * 0.5])
```

**Rationale:**
- **Amplitude**: 5%-200% of peak signal (prevents unrealistic solutions)
- **Center**: Within analysis window (temporal locality)
- **Width**: 2%-50% of time range (reasonable flare durations)

# 5. Statistical Quality Assessment

## 5.1 Coefficient of Determination (R²)

```python
r_squared = 1 - SS_res/SS_tot
```

Where:
- **SS_res** = Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² (residual sum of squares)
- **SS_tot** = Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)² (total sum of squares)

**Physical Interpretation:** R² measures the fraction of variance explained by the multi-Gaussian model.

## 5.2 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

```python
rmse = √(1/n × Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²)
```

**Units:** Same as original signal (log₁₀ flux units)
**Significance:** Quantifies typical fitting error magnitude

---

# 6. Advanced Analysis Techniques

## 6.1 Second Derivative Peak Finding

```python
second_derivative = np.gradient(np.gradient(smoothed))
potential_peaks, _ = find_peaks(-second_derivative)
```

**Mathematical Principle:** 
- **Inflection Points**: d²y/dt² = 0 identifies potential peak centers
- **Negative Second Derivative**: Indicates local maxima (peak locations)

**Physical Rationale:** Identifies subtle energy release episodes that may be obscured in complex overlapping events.

## 6.2 Component Validation

The algorithm tests multiple component numbers (2-5) and ranks results by R²:

```python
results.sort(key=lambda x: x['r_squared'], reverse=True)
```

**Statistical Principle:** **Model Selection** - balances fit quality against model complexity to avoid overfitting.

# 7. Physical Parameter Extraction

## 7.1 Individual Component Properties

For each identified component:

```python
# Energy proxy: Area under Gaussian curve
energy_proxy = A × σ × √(2π)

# Duration: Full Width at Half Maximum  
fwhm = 2.355 × σ

# Peak flux
peak_flux = A
```

## 7.2 Multi-Channel Analysis

**XRSA vs XRSB Comparison:**
- **Temperature Information**: Flux ratio indicates plasma temperature
- **Energy Partition**: Different energy bands reveal heating mechanisms
- **Temporal Correlation**: Simultaneous peaks suggest common reconnection events
